Perhaps the most relevant datafiles that most people will be interested in are:

[The full dataset (in .csv format) for most species analyzed in this study](Data/full_dataset_revisions_10_2017.csv) and [the phylogenetic tree used to analyze that full dataset for bacteria](Data/Pruned_tree_Domain_Bacteria_10_2017.newick)

As well as:

[The growth rate dataset (which contains a distinct set of species from those listed in the above data files](Data/growth_rate_dataset_10_2017_EXTENDED.csv) and [the corresponding phylogenetic tree for these data](Data/growth_rates_RAxML.newick)

These datasets have a lot of columns, most of which are named in a straightforward manner. But if there are any questions with the nomenclature, issues with running the code, or general questions, please feel free to reach out. 

As of this writing, I believe that the supplied code can be used to recreate all figures in the paper (python >=3.0, jupyter notebook, and relevant libraries imported at the top of individual files required). The code is, however, not written (in its currently supplied form) to permit extensions to novel species/datasets. Though I should add that I am happy to work with anyone to do so should anyone find this functionality useful for novel applications or extensions.

The corresponding manuscript (https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msx310) is open access but should anyone have issues accessing or understanding it, please don't hesitate to reach out as well.
